## 🧾 Project Overview

This project offers a minimalist interface where users can input text and generate corresponding QR codes. While the repository contains `index.html` and `style.css` files, it appears that the QR code generation functionality may rely on an external JavaScript library, such as [QRCode.js](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/), although this is not explicitly included in the repository files.
